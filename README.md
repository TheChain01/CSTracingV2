# Searching for Nearby Points of Interest

Provide automatic search completions based on a user's partial search query, and search the map for relevant locations nearby.

## Requirements

The CSTracing (Crowd-Sourced Tracing) app is a tool to record location data of confirmed COVID19 patients. Users can submit their last significant locations at which they were present while possibly being infected by the virus. Other users that are not infected can consult a map which shows them the time at which various location were visited by COVID19 patient. This make the population more aware if they were in contact with someone carrying the virus or if they visited such location to then encourage them to get tested. The software relies on crowd-sourced data. It relies on such data in order to respect people's privacy. Other solutions to this problem could see the use of GPS location or Bluetooth beacon and such but they rely on technology that harvest the public's data and could force people to share such data without their proper consent. 

## CODE
Most of the code present in this directory was written by myself. These files can be found under the "original" folder. There is files on which I iterated in order to adapt them to this use that can be found under the MapSearch folder. The sub-folder called Ressources holds the files required for the build as well as the storyboard. 

## BUILD PROCEDURE

## Link to the base APPLE MapKit 
This is the link ot the base files that were first iterated upon in order to complete this project.
